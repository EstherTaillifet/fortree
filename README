Fortree is a python app that creates call trees of your fortran code. 
Fortree makes call trees, definition trees and dependencies trees.

To use Fortree:
1) Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine (you need: numpy, gv, re).
2) Create an initalization file (use init.txt given as an example).
3) launch the code as so: ~$ Python3 fortree.py init.txt

Contains:
init.py
fortree.py
parser.py
treeNode.py
render.py
module.py
routine.py
